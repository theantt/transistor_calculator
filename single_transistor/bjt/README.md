# Single Transistor Amplifiers - BJTs

### Common Emitter Amplifier
- Uses a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) in a common emitter configuration
- Input signal is applied to the base terminal, amplified output is taken from the collector terminal
- Emitter terminal provides a return path for current flowing through the transistor
- High voltage gain: amplifies small input signals to a larger output level
- High current gain: can drive large loads without significant power loss
- Phase shift of 180 degrees between input and output signals: output is inverted with respect to the input signal
- Widely used in many electronic applications, including radio and television transmitters and audio amplifiers

### Common Base Amplifier
- Uses a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) in a common base configuration
- Input signal is applied to the emitter terminal, amplified output is taken from the collector terminal
- Base terminal provides a return path for current flowing through the transistor
- Low voltage gain: not very good at amplifying small input signals to a larger output level
- High current gain: can drive large loads without significant power loss
- Phase shift of zero degrees between input and output signals: output is in phase with the input signal
- Not as widely used as other amplifier configurations, but can be useful in certain applications where a low voltage gain and high current gain are desired

### Common Collector Amplifier
- Also known as an emitter follower
- Uses a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) in a common collector configuration
- Input signal is applied to the base terminal, amplified output is taken from the emitter terminal
- Collector terminal provides a return path for current flowing through the transistor
- Low voltage gain: not very good at amplifying small input signals to a larger output level
- High current gain: can drive large loads without significant power loss
- Phase shift of zero degrees between input and output signals: output is in phase with the input signal
- Not as widely used as other amplifier configurations, but can be useful in certain applications where a low voltage gain and high current gain are desired
- Often used as a buffer amplifier to isolate one circuit from another or to match the impedance of one circuit to another
