# Single Transistor Amplifiers - MOS

### Common Source Amplifier
- MOSFET acts as a voltage-controlled resistor
- Input signal applied to the gate
- Output taken from the drain
- Source connected to ground
- Provides high voltage gain but low input impedance and high output impedance
- Can be used as a voltage amplifier or a voltage-controlled resistor in certain applications.
- Poor high frequency performance



### Common Gate Amplifier
- MOSFET acts as a current amplifier
- Input signal applied to the source
- Output taken from the drain
- Gate connected to ground
- Provides low voltage gain (typically less than 1) but high input impedance and low output impedance
- Can be used as a buffer amplifier to isolate a circuit from load effects or to match the impedance of one circuit to another
- Can also be used as a current-to-voltage converter or as a current-controlled resistor in certain applications

### Common drain amplifier
- Also known as a source follower
- MOSFET acts as a current-controlled resistor
- Input signal applied to the gate
- Output taken from the source
- Drain connected to a voltage supply
- Provides low voltage gain (typically less than 1) but high input impedance and low output impedance
- Used as a buffer amplifier to isolate a circuit from load effects, or to match the impedance of one circuit to another
- Can also be used as a voltage-to-current converter or as a voltage-controlled resistor in certain applications.
