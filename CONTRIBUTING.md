# Contribution Guidelines

1. Submit an issue before starting work on a new feature or bug fix. This allows the maintainers to verify that the work is necessary and relevant, and to provide guidance on the best approach to take.

2. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your work. This helps to keep the main repository clean and allows for easy isolation of changes.

3. Write tests for your code. This helps to ensure that the code works as intended and that future changes do not break existing functionality.

4. Write clear and concise code that follows the project's coding style. Use comments to explain any complex or non-obvious parts of the code.

5. Update the documentation as needed to reflect any changes made to the code.

6. Submit a pull request when the work is complete. Include a brief description of the changes made and any relevant issues or references.

7. Be responsive to feedback from the maintainers and other contributors. If changes are requested, make them in a timely manner.

By following these guidelines, you can help to make the contribution process smooth and efficient for everyone involved.
